# Phone Bill Program

A program to register the different phone calls made in one month and show the bill.

## How does it work?
- The user is asked to choose one of the option from the menu.

    - If option 1 is chosen, the user is asked to select a type of call (local, national or international)
        - If it is a local call, the user must pick the time of the call to calculate the fare
        - If it is a national call, the user must pick the province to calculate the fare
        - If it is an international call, the user must pick a country from South America to calculate the fare
    
    - If option 2 is chosen, the program will show the final bill

    - If option 3 is chosen, the program will finish.
